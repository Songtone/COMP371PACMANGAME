This application is a replica of the game pacman.
The goal is to move pacman around the grid and collect all the food which are represented by green dots on the grid.
There are 4 ghosts that are represented as cubes and different colors that will chase pacman across the grid.
The ghosts have different speeds to make them less predictable.
To move pacman, you will use the WASD keys (W to move upwards, D to move to the right, S to move downwards and A to move to the left).
To increase the size of the objects, you can press U and to decrease their size you can press J.
To get the line polygons of the objects you can press L.
To get the point polygons of the objects you can press P.
To get the triangle polygons of the objects you can press T which is the original state of the polygons.
Holding right button on the mouse will allow you to pan left and right.
Holding the left button on the mouse will allow you to zoom in and out.
Holding the middle mouse button will allow you to tilt the grid. (WARNING: it does not work perfectly).
To reset pacman, you can press spacebar.
To reset all the objects (pacman, food and ghosts), you can press R.
To reset the world and its orientation, you can press the HOME button.

Enjoy the GAME!
